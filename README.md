# Isaac Goldberg's Improved Polar Graphing Calculator

Link to live site here: [https://isaac-goldberg.github.io/polar-grapher/](https://isaac-goldberg.github.io/polar-grapher/)

This graphing calculator was made to help with the visualization of limaçon curves, which are graphs in a polar coordinate system of the form *r = a sinθ ± b*, or *r = a cosθ ± b*. Points on a curve in the polar coordinate system can be difficult to know because one point can have different coordinates, so this calculator helps show the correct ones.

The graphing animation and the point tooltips are features not offered by other well-known calculators such as Desmos, which is why I made this website. However, **this calculator CANNOT graph other equations - only basic sine and cosine curves.** It also can't even do basic algebra. Use Desmos for that.
